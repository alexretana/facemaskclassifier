File imglist.txt contains all the labels for images from different folders (1 -> 9).

A image is labeled 0 <-> it contains a person wearing mask.
A image is labeled 1 <-> it contains a person not wearing mask.
A image is labeled 2 <-> it is difficult to classify or it doesn't contain a person.

We only use images labeled 0 and 1 for training (imglist_train.txt) and testing (imglist_test.txt) purposes.

Folder labels contains label files for different folders as well as a folder named raw containing all the raw label files from our team.
