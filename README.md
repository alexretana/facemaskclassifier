Computer Vision Project: Face Detection and Mask Classification

Note: Caffe prototxt and modelweights downloaded from [here](https://github.com/LZQthePlane/Face-detection-base-on-ResnetSSD)

[similar project](https://github.com/aome510/Mask-Classifier) to look for inspiration, and maybe pretrained models

plan to do transfer learning. probably going to want to follow up with this article to serve from OpenCV instead from keras : https://github.com/adoval4/keras_to_OpenCV_tensorflow


Heavily inspired by [this pyimagesearch article](https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2019/05/20/transfer-learning-with-keras-and-deep-learning/)
